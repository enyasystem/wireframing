# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual representation or blueprint of a digital product, such as a website or mobile app, before the actual design or development begins.  
It focuses on the layout, structure, and placement of elements like buttons, menus, and content — without worrying about colors, fonts, or images.

In simple terms, a wireframe is a *skeleton* that shows how a product will work and how users will interact with it.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

1. **Clarifies Structure and Functionality**  
   - Wireframes help designers and stakeholders understand how the product’s layout and navigation will function.

2. **Saves Time and Resources**  
   - Identifying layout or usability issues early in wireframes prevents costly redesigns later in development.

3. **Improves Collaboration**  
   - Wireframes provide a shared visual reference that helps designers, developers, and clients stay aligned.

4. **Focuses on User Experience (UX)**  
   - By emphasizing flow and usability over visuals, wireframes ensure that the# wireframing

## Key Elements of Wireframing

Wireframes outline the structure and functionality of a website or app before the final design stage. The key elements found in a wireframe include:

1. Layout Structure

This defines the overall arrangement of the page — how sections like the header, main content, and footer are positioned.
Example:
A homepage wireframe might have the navigation bar at the top, a hero section in the center, and a footer at the bottom. This helps ensure the layout is organized and visually balanced.

2. Navigation

Navigation elements show how users will move through the site or app.
Example:
Menus, sidebars, and breadcrumbs are added to wireframes to demonstrate the flow between pages (e.g., clicking “About” takes users to the About page).
This ensures users can find what they need easily.

3. Content Placement

This represents where text, images, and media will appear — without focusing on colors or actual content.
Example:
Placeholder boxes and lines (often labeled “Image” or “Text”) indicate where content will go, helping designers visualize spacing and hierarchy.

4. Functionality

Even though wireframes are not yet interactive, they often include notes or icons to show how elements will behave.
Example:
Buttons may have annotations like “opens login form” or “scrolls to section,” explaining their purpose and planned interaction.
